# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Python  
🚀 A Python implementation of the Breadth-First Search algorithm for graph traversal and target searching.

## Features  
- 🧠 Implements the BFS algorithm using `deque` and `set`.  
- 🌐 Includes a sample graph to demonstrate functionality.  
- 🔍 Customizable target search to suit different needs.

## Example Graph  
The program uses the following graph for demonstration:  
'siz':['ali', 'vali', 'tohir'],
'ali':['aziza', 'olim'],
'vali':['botir', 'ziyoda'],
'tohir':['elon musk', 'mohir'],
'olim':[],
'aziza':[],
'botir':[],
'ziyoda':['aziza'],
'elon musk':[],
'mohir':[]

### How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
git clone https://github.com/Mr-Cullen-1/Breadth-First.git

Navigate to the project folder:
cd Breadth-First

Run the program:
python main.py

Modify the graph or target to customize the search:
search('start_node', 'target_name')

**Requirements:**
Python 3.x
No additional libraries required! 🎉

**Output**
The program prints whether the target is found and stops the search upon success:
elon musk has found!
